# School project
This was my school project for computer graphics class. It requires vs studio 2022 and external dependencies that can be downloaded here http://cg.elte.hu/~bsc_cg/resources/OGLPack.zip (a website of the school, it mostly in hungarian)
the vs project is setup to find the folder with the dependecies in T drive. You can either change it in the project or put the folder in the root of C: and on windows run "subst t: c:\" command
